# EasyBitcoin

EasyBitcoin is a simple haskell library providing types and class-instances for bitcoin related code; 
it also include an small set of functions to handle addresses and transactions.

I tried to keep it as simple as possible while yet, being usefull to code applications that need to read/create simple 
bitcoin transactions and multisignature escrows. It started as a forked from the Haskoin haskell bitcoin library.


Documentation about it usage and some examples can be found on it Hackage page.
